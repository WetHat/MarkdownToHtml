# Static HTML Site Project Template - Readme

_If you are reading this `README` file as Markdown source, consider building the
project first by running the build script `Build.ps1` and then open
`README.html` in the browser._

Site projects allow you to build static HTML sites from Markdown sources
in a fast and simple way. Just add Markdown content to the project's `markdown`
directory and then run the build script to update the HTML site.

The initial configuration of the project contains all site assets locally.
This allows the site to be viewed offline (without internet connection). 

## What Next?

The project is fully functional with the out-of-the-box configuration.

To author the HTML site following do this:
1. Create Markdown files (`*.md`) in the `markdown` directory of the project.
   All resources linked to by Markdown content such as images or videos should
   also added be to this directory. Make sure to use only **relative** links to 
   other markdown or media files.
2. Build the site by executing the build script `Build.ps1`.
3. Locate the site's home page in the `html` directory and open it in the
   browser

# Feature Showcase

In the following sections some selected features are of the
capabilities of `MarkdownToHTML` are demonstrated.

## Mermaid Diagrams

Markdown extension: `mermaid`:

``` markdown
~~~ mermaid
stateDiagram
	[*] --> Still
	Still --> [*]

	Still --> Moving
	Moving --> Still
	Moving --> Crash
	Crash --> [*]
~~~
```

rendered as:

~~~ mermaid
stateDiagram
	[*] --> Still
	Still --> [*]

	Still --> Moving
	Moving --> Still
	Moving --> Crash
	Crash --> [*]
~~~

## LaTeX Math

Markdown extensions: `mathematics`:

~~~ markdown
$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 
\leq 
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)  
$$
~~~

renders as:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 
\leq 
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)  
$$

## Code Syntax Highlighting

Markdown extension: `common`

``` markdown
~~~ cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  /* An annoying "Hello World" example */
  for (auto i = 0; i < 0xFFFF; i++)
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;

  char c = '\n';
  unordered_map <string, vector<string> > m;
  m["key"] = "\\\\"; // this is an error

  return -2e3 + 12l;
}
~~~
```

renders as:

~~~ cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  /* An annoying "Hello World" example */
  for (auto i = 0; i < 0xFFFF; i++)
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;

  char c = '\n';
  unordered_map <string, vector<string> > m;
  m["key"] = "\\\\"; // this is an error

  return -2e3 + 12l;
}
