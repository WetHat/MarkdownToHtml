# Test-LocalSiteLinks

Verify that relative links to files and images exist in a Markdown
source tree.

# Syntax
```PowerShell
 Test-LocalSiteLinks [-Path] <String>  [<CommonParameters>] 
```


# Description


Scans a directory tree for Markdown files and `Build.json` files. Relative links found in these
files are checked. Broken links are reported. Link checking is not restricted to files in a
static site project generated by [`New-StaticHTMLSiteProject`](New-StaticHTMLSiteProject.md), though that is most likely its
primary use.





# Parameters

<blockquote>



## -Path \<String\>

<blockquote>

Path to the root of a directory tree containing Markdown sources.
Typically this is the sources directory configured in `Build.json` by
`markdown_dir`. See
[Static Site Project Customization](about_MarkdownToHTML.md#static-site-project-customization)
for more information.

# Examples


## EXAMPLE 1

> ~~~ PowerShell
> Test-LocalSiteLinks -Path E:\lab\...\markdown
> ~~~
>
> 
> Generate a report for broken relative links in Markdown files and `Build.json`
> files found under the `E:\lab\...\markdown` directory tree.
> 
> The broken links report looks similar to this:
> ~~~
> File                                              Line Link                      Error
> ----                                              ---- ----                      -----
> E:\lab\...\Settings\Manage Settings.md               5 images/RibbonSetting1.png File not found
> E:\lab\...\Settings\Manage Settings.md              14 Tabs/About Tab.md         Malformed url
> E:\lab\...\Settings\Build.json         site_navigation {"Options": "Tabs1"}     File not found
> ~~~
> 
> The output above shows the theww types of error that are currently recognized:
> 1. The file `RibbonSetting1.png` is not found in the `images` directory next
>    to file `Manage Settings.md`
> 2. The link `Tabs/About Tab.md` is malformed because urls cannot contain spaces.
>    The link needs to be URL encoded. The correct way ro write this url is:
>    `Tabs/About%20Tab.md`
> 3. A navigation specification with label `Options` in the `site_navigation`
>    section of the reported `Build.json` file points to the non-existing
>    file or directory `Tabs1`
